# Impresso JSON Schemas

This repository contains the JSON schemas used in the [Impresso project](https://impresso-project.ch/).

Impresso JSON Schemas are used to define, declare, validate and document the structure, constraint  and data types of Impresso JSON documents that can represent data or processes (e.g. manifests).


### Schemas
We define schemas for:
#### Newspaper data
  - Canonical format:
      - [Issue](docs/issue.md) (draft 06)
      - [Page](docs/page.md) (draft 06)
      - [Audio Record](docs/audio_record.md) (draft 06)
  - Rebuilt format:
      - [Paper Content Item](docs/paper_contentitem.md) (draft 06)
      - [Audio Record Content Item](docs/audio_record_contentitem.md) (draft 06)
#### Semantic enrichments
  - Topic Model
      - [Topic Assignment](docs/topic_assignment.md) (draft 06)
      - [Topic Description](docs/topic_description.md) (draft 06)
  - Language Identification
      - [Language Identification](docs/language_identification.md) (draft 06)
  - Entities
    - [Entities](docs/entities.md) (2020-12)
  - [OCR Quality Assessment](docs/ocr_qa.md) (OCR-QA)
