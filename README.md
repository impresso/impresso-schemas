# Impresso JSON Schemas

This repository contains the JSON schemas used in the [Impresso project](https://impresso-project.ch/).

Impresso JSON Schemas are used to define, declare, validate and document the structure, constraint  and data types of Impresso JSON documents that can represent data or processes (e.g. manifests).
