## confidence

Confidence score of the prediction - if class was assigned through predictions.

`confidence`

*   is optional

*   Type: `number`

*   cannot be null

*   defined in: [Untitled schema](image_classification-defs-prediction-properties-confidence.md "https://impresso.github.io/impresso-schemas/json/image_classification/image_classification.schema.json#/$defs/prediction/properties/confidence")

### confidence Type

`number`

### confidence Constraints

**maximum**: the value of this number must smaller than or equal to: `1`

**minimum**: the value of this number must greater than or equal to: `0`

## pred\_number

'Number' of the prediction in the top-3, ie. if it was the first, second or third most probable value. Not applicable if class is inferred from the typology hierarchy.

`pred_number`

*   is optional

*   Type: `integer`

*   cannot be null

*   defined in: [Untitled schema](image_classification-defs-prediction-properties-pred_number.md "https://impresso.github.io/impresso-schemas/json/image_classification/image_classification.schema.json#/$defs/prediction/properties/pred_number")

`integer`

### pred\_number Constraints

**maximum**: the value of this number must smaller than or equal to: `3`

**minimum**: the value of this number must greater than or equal to: `1`

## is\_inferred

True if the prediction is inferred from another level in typology (eg. 'entertainment' inferred at level 2 if level 3 is 'game'). False if the class was predicted by a model; this field cannot be true for level-3.

`is_inferred`

*   is required

*   Type: `boolean`

*   cannot be null

*   defined in: [Untitled schema](image_classification-defs-prediction-properties-is_inferred.md "https://impresso.github.io/impresso-schemas/json/image_classification/image_classification.schema.json#/$defs/prediction/properties/is_inferred")
